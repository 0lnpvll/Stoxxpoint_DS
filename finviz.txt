	By applying filters, users can efficiently narrow down a list of stocks for in-depth technical or fundamental analysis using third-party paid or free software.In the example provided above, you can easily insert the filtered list of tickers into the appropriate field on the Finviz platform to select stocks that are in an uptrend using technical analysis. This way, you obtain a list of stocks that are highly rated by both the platform and the market itself.

	It is important to note that a high stock rating does not automatically signal a buy opportunity, as cheap stocks may also carry significant risks. Conversely, a low rating does not necessarily indicate limited investment potential.

	All valuation methods have inherent limitations, and their outputs should be considered alongside other analytical approaches to inform well-rounded investment decisions!!!
